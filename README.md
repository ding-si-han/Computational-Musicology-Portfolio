## Motivations
The corpus I have selected is the Spotify Playlist: Your Top Songs 2021, an exciting playlist to analyse as it features the songs that a user has listened to the most over in the past year and that will be very indicative of the userâ€™s music taste and preferences.

To make it even more interesting, I will be comparing my girlfriend and my playlists to examine what are some of the similarities and differences. As people with similar personalities yet different hobbies and interests, it will be intriguing to examine where our music choices converge and elements where they differ. Hence, the key research question that I will seek to address is to what extent are our musical preferences different and whether it encapsulate the differences in our lifestyle and pace of living.

##  Comparison Points
Out of the multiple features to analyse, some of the indicative ones that will be interesting to analyse are the energy and the danceability of the songs that are in our playlists. This will be quite indicative of our preferences of the mood of the songs that we prefer to listen to. Another interesting feature to examine will be the instrumentalness, which will be a good measure of which of us prefers to listen to music tends toward the singing or the instrumentation, and also a reflection of possibly our motives toward listening to music.

## Representativeness
Personally, both of us listen to our music primarily on Spotify. In fact, more than 90% of the music that we listen to is on Spotify itself. As a result, this would make the Spotify API and these playlists pretty accurate and representative of our musical tastes.
