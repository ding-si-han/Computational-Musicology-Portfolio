This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(spotifyr)
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}

sihan_songs <- get_my_top_artists_or_tracks(type = 'tracks', 
                             time_range = 'long_term', 
                             limit = 50)
sihan_song_features <- get_track_audio_features(sihan_songs$id)
sihan_song_features = sihan_song_features %>%
  mutate(listener="Si Han")
sihan_song_features
```

```{r}
write.csv(sihan_song_features,"./sihan.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```


When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
